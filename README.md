discount-rpm
============

Manages packaging [Discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) as an RPM.

The module should probably build Discount from [source](https://github.com/Orc/discount), but as an expediency all it currently does is copy the packaging from [RepoForge](http://repoforge.org) and upload it to the repository's GitHub downloads page.

This package is made available from DTO Lab's [third-party packages](http://dtolabs.github.com/third-party-packages) Yum repositories principally as a convenience to [Rerun](http://rerun.github.com/rerun) users who don't want to (or can't) use RepoForge directly.
